# Polynomial Calculator

This project was created in collaboration with 2 other students as a final oroject for Programming Languages, a class taken during the Spring2021 semester at Appalachian State University.

Upon opening the exec, the user is asked to input 2 polynomials in a given format. After inputing the polynomials, the application displays different operands the user can select.

## Format

[(2,2),(3,1),(-7,0)] = 2x^2 + 3x - 7

[(0,2),(-4,1),(6,0)] = 0x^2 - 4x + 6

The user must input the polynomail in [(value, exponent]) form. The format must be structured around the value of the highest polynomial. If a polynomial doesn't contain an exponent the other does contain, they must type (0, exponent) to ensure the calculations will be correct. 
If you are doing an operand that only requires one polynomial, when you are prompted to input a second polynomial please press 'enter' to move on.
